## üíª About the challenge
Let's put into practice everything that was seen in this third phase! üòç
The idea now is to create the **Space Cream** in the Desktop version! üöÄ

  Here is the [**link**](https://www.figma.com/file/pddZCuQIRLjk5dEHQ4L4YR/Stage-03---Grid-com-anima%C3%A7%C3%B5es/duplicate) with the layout of the application. It will open a file like the image below:

Pay attention to the content that was taught in class. So **in this** challenge, remember to use:

- Grid;
- Animations and transitions, as seen in class;
- Media queries.

Good luck and let's code! **üöÄ**
